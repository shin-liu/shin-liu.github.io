Thanks to my Korean friend Doosan’s invitation, I had a chance to see an authentic shaman ritual today. Doosan told me that today’s ritual served to pray for luck and safety in the house1. The ritual was held at Doosan’s grandma’s house. All his family members attended, including his father, who is a famous dentist in the Hwanghaedo region. 

Before we started the trip to his grandma’s house, I did a little background studying of shaman ritual. A shaman is a person regarded as having access to the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits. He or she will induce a state of possession in which the soul would leave the body to travel in space and to call on the appropriate spirits to manifest their intentions. When possessed by spirits, a shaman makes prophecies, cures diseases, placates dead souls, and controls natural and unnatural phenomena2. 
Shamanism has played an important role in the Korean culture since prehistoric times. Despite the progress of modern science and the fact that people’s attitudes toward shamanism changed as other belief systems were introduced and advocated, shamanism is still practiced today, even in highly westernized cities like Seoul3. Therefore, I am not very surprised when I saw Doosan’s father attending the event.

When we arrived, the ritual was just about to start. I bet that women in Doosan’s family 
must did a lot of preparation for this ritual. The house is small but very clean. They moved sofas away to make a square space for the ritual in the living room. On the table next the the wall, there were a lot of oblations, including several kinds of fruit, salt and moon cakes. All oblations were nicely placed in different silver containers. In the front of the room there were two small altars. There were a long white candle and a white paper tree in each altar. 

The shamaness and her team came in. The shamaness dressed in bright red dress and was wearing a red embroidered hat, while all her four accompanies dressed in pure white. There was a old man in them, who was wearing a black cone-shaped hat and holding a pen-shaped bamboo flute in his hand. The other three were women －one was about 50 years-old, and the other two were young ladies. The older women had a Korean drum on her waist. One of the young girls was holding a pair of cymbals and the other carried a big bag. After all white-dressed people seated down on the side and started the music, the shaman ritual officially started. 

The shamaness raised her arms, with a bell cluster and cymbal on her right hand and a fan on her left hand. She closed her eyes and occasionally opened them narrowly. Her mouth was murmuring something silently. The drum was the main music background. 

After around thirty seconds, her arms started to shake slightly. Then after a sudden strong shake from her breast, she started to move both arms up and down while waving the fan and shaking the bells - as if spirits were urged to present themselves. She looked up and down with her arm movements. The flute and her bell clusters were the main music during this time. She then put down everything in her hand and kneeled down to pray towards the altar. All Doosan’s family members also kneeled down and prayed. I didn’t want to look unrespectful at all, so I imitated them and kneeled down as well. 
The shamaness went to the back of the room and when she came out, she was wearing a red dress with white sleeves and a white priest’s hat. In her hand there were a pair of cymbals that were chained together by a white cloth. While she was stepping and turning counterclockwise, she violently stroke the cymbals together with her arms moving down and up. She kept striking but now stood still. When her arms and the upper torso moved down, she dropped the cymbals. After staring at the cymbals on the ground for several seconds, she picked them up, and then repeated the same thing twice. The last time she turned around, striking the cymbals and made a praying gesture. Then she turned back and dropped the cymbals for the last time. 
	
After the ritual Doosan told me that by playing with the cymbals the shamaness became possessed and was able to deliver the oracle. The reason that she threw down the cymbals was that she then could divinate auspicious or inauspicious omens by observing the way the cymbals have fallen4. 
	
Now the fun part began. The shamaness picked up her cymbals and walked to the front of the room. She started half speaking and half singing, a little bit like Beijing opera. It felt as if she was negotiating or arguing with someone, because she used her left arm to point all the time and she looked angry. With my limited Korean, I realized that she was actually presenting Doosan’s families’ worries and wishes to the spirits5. I remembered that she said to the spirits about taking 
good care of Doosan’s grandfather in the otherworld, bringing health to all the family members, 
and bestowing Doosan a good career and marriage. After stating all the requests, she picked up a small water container and used to a white paper brush to dip water and purifies the room - as if all the promises would residue in this house. 

The ritual became even more interesting and intense. One young lady sitting on the side putted on a blue coat, pulled a sharp knife out of the bag which she carried and stood up. She started to whirl around in a frenzied manner, moving her body up and down. Then she rubbed the knife over her wrist and held the knife in her mouth! The scene was so intense and scary. I was worried that she would accidentally cut her face in half. However, this part ended successfully. From my point of view, playing with knife demonstrated the power of the spirits which have control over people’s fates.

The climax of the event came as the ritual moved out to the yard. Doosan’s family members surrounded the shamaness who was now in a red dress with green sleeves. They kept praying when she danced frenzily with a long knife in each hand. The music became quicker with the flute being emphasized. The shamaness made quick chopping movements and pointed both knives toward her heart. Despite the strong underlying pulse of the musical accompaniment, the shamaness only occasionally stepped to the pulse. More frequently she executed patterns that only coexist with the music, rather than conform to any particular rhythmic pattern. 

The shamaness was constantly bouncing - in addition to bending and extending knees slightly, she shifted her weight as well. Many movements did not have a clear spatial focus. They were simply done without being directed toward a particular object or direction7. Despite her cumbersome costume, she tended to carry her weight on the balls of feet and maintain an upward focus rather than landing heavily downward into the ground. 
As if brandishing knives were not powerful and intense enough, the shamaness changed to dance with a long and wide blade. While she kept bouncing, she flipped the blade around to look at its sharpness. Then she held the blade in her mouth for several times with a dismissive facial expression. To further show off the spirit's’ power, she rubbed the blade on her face and her forearm! 
Now the ritual shifted to the final part. Doosan’s uncles helped to build an altar which was about six feet high. Two blades were fixed vertically on the top. At the mean time, the dance was performed that used sacred banners in five colors - red, blue, white, yellow and green. Doosan explained to me that divination was possible by the shamaness pulling one streamer and observing its color6. When the high altar was ready, the shamaness climbed onto the top and stood on the blades! The musicians played affectionately to accompany the entrance into this sacred moment. All Doosan’s family members gathered beneath her, slightly touching her feet and putting money on the altar. It seemed that doing so would bring the family members divine virtues7. 
The ritual ended with people’s praying to the shamaness and the start of a traditional Korean lunch. My understanding of the Korean society was deepened by this shaman ritual and I truly wish Doosan’s family health and auspiciousness.

Zile, Judy. Perspectives on Korean Dance. Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University
Press, 2001. This book is very comprehensive. It introduces history, techniques of different kinds of Korean dances. Van Zile’s volume starts by giving a broad view. An initial chapter is titled ‘The Many Faces of Korean Dance’ and moves from a historical consideration to choreography, contemporary dance, and ballet. The central part of the book looks at specific dances, including the dance I wrote about - shamanism.
